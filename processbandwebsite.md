# Band Website Process
### Alicia Sutedja

`The whole process of doing the band website was fairly simple. I just looked up a good free css template from the list you have in your github. Then Daniel was the one who was going to code from his laptop, so I just put it in textmate and airdropped him the code and he adjusted the information to what we want. Bella did our bios, and then I proceeded to make our band poster for the website.`

`Then, we started talking about what we wanted to be, so we decided to be a jazz trio, with keys, vocals, and bass. The band poster I did on canva, very simple and quick. Daniel started to put into code again and sorting out everything we needed for the website. We initially couldn't get the image to pop up, but then me and Daniel were talking to just push the website first and see what happens. Daniel said the image just suddenly came up all of a sudden so I'm not so sure how that happened haha.`

`When we looked up the website it was working, so Bella was asking us what else to put on the website, then she sent a venmo qr code haha which we then added. And then I asked Dan to put the code for the send us a message section from the css template for us to put it in there as well. Last thing was the link that we wanted to add for our music which Dan was in charge of.`

**Chapter One**

* One thing I knew was that all values play different roles, obviously, haha, but other than that everything I learned was very new.

* There were so many new things I learned, but one thing that kept getting stuck with me was the fact that boolean turned out to be something so important. I think in Chapter One it kind of made it seem as if boolean is just true or false and doesn't change anything else. I also didn't know that there's so many different symbols than the normal math symbols to represent basic math symbols.

**Chapter Two**

* I definitely didn't know any of the new expressions so I'm just going to write two new things that I really liked learning. First has to be the if and else in conditional execution. Especially seeing every element play and things starting to make sense (Example: !Number.isNan (theNumber)), to check if number is valid or not.
* Second thing has to be learning how to break out of a loop. I like how I started to see this in a practical way, like seeing this code being used let's say when scheduling something (an appointment, etc.) and the code just runs over and over again in a loop until it can find like current % 15 == 0.
* Learning the shortcuts was also nice!

**Chapter Three**

* I really liked the idea of using function. I like how it's not like let or while, it can be a loop, but it can also break out of its own loop easily, and the code is much simpler than the do loop or while. Like the practice in chapter 3 (recursion) i find really interesting and it makes sense.
* I also like reassigning functions. I like how if we declare with let, then we can kind of overwrite the code with something else. I like the missle example. I like the examples in this chapter, it makes more sense.

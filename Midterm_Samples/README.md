#### Samples
`I'm very proud that I did not use chatgpt for this one! hahaha. I saw what you did with one sample, and kind of saw how it worked and how logically it would make sense for me to put the other two samples. So my first logic on starting it, was to add the other two sounds in the let. Then, I just loaded the other two sounds in the preload function. I didn't change the setup at all and the soundLoaded function. Going to the keyPressed function, I just kind of experimented and thought that I could just put if else and added playcustomsoundone two and three and I thought I would be wrong at first so this was truly just experimenting.`

`My first mistake was in the key pressed. I treated it the same way as the custom sound function. I had made two other functions of the keypressed but it was only the last button that was working. So then I tried if and else, then it worked! I'm pretty sure there is a much easier way to do this compared to making seperate functions for each one, especially the custom sound one, but I'm just happy I didn't use chatgpt for this one lmao haha`

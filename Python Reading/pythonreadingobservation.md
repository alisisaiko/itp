# Python Reading
### Alicia Sutedja

`Chapter 1: I'm familiar with most of the things that they were talking about. I feel like it's similar to js but it seems simpler (so far). Some things I didn't know was like the floating point numbers, and like new things like ** means power.`

`Chapter 3: I wasnt familiar with anything in this chapter. Or like the details. I was familiar with some of the things they were talking about, roughly, but the details not really. Things like float (converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers), int (convert floating point into integers. doesn’t round off, str (convert argument into a string), it’s cool that they can do arithmetic like x=math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi), def is keyword that indicates a function definition, cat_twice(part1, part2) → when creating variable inside a function, it’s local. so it exists inside the function, traceback: nice that they can tell you what program file the error occured in.`

`Chapter 5: I of course was familiar with if else statements, boolean, the relational operators that they talked about in this chapter, but again, the nitty gritty I was not familiar with. So again, I'll just list the things I learned about. 
- modulus operator, %, which divides two numbers and returns the remainder.
- elif: abbreciation of else if. there is no limit on the number of elif statements. BUT if there’s an else clause, elif has to be at the end. but there doesn’t have to be one → if choice == 'a': draw_a() elif choice == 'b': draw_b() elif choice == 'c': draw_c()
- nested conditionals with logical operators → if 0 < x < 10: print (’x is a positive single-digit number.’)
- recursion also but simpler in python.
- /n is a line break.`

`Chapter 10: With lists, I think it's fairly different from what we've learned in js. We've also never really gotten that into lists, so I'm just going to list the things I learned.
- >>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] 
- >>> numbers = [42, 123]
- >>> empty = [] 
- >>> print(cheeses, numbers, empty) 
['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] [42, 123] []
- lists are mutable.
- can have slice operator as well
- can also delete elements from a list using a del`

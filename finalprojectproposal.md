# Final Project Proposal
### Alicia Sutedja
`The title of my project would most likely be AI-Powered Travel Itinerary Generator.`

`My project is going to be a website that helps people plan their trips using AI. You just put in your destination, dates, and what you're into, and it'll give you a custom itinerary with activities, etc.`

`Resources that I will be using would probably be Google Maps API, OpenWeather API, and most probably using react.js and express.js (something that I can use for frontend and backend, of course that is after consulting with prof. Rachel :))`

`This project is essentially like a smart travel planning website that makes life easier for anyone trying to figure out what to do on a trip. You'll enter where you're doing, the dates, the kind of things you like (food, nature, museums, etc.) as well as other preferences and the site will generate a schedule with activities and estimated travel time to everything. I hope it can also make like a calendar that you then can sync to and share to the group. It'll also show maps and weather so you can plan ahead. I'm planning to build it with a react.js frontend and express.js backend. I'll use a couple of APIs to get real data. Eventually I would really love to expand it with things like flight and hotel search, as well as prices. Also a chatbot for live help, and definitely budgeting tools.`

`There is no overlap in this project.`

`I totally get that things don't always go as planned, especially with coding and that I'm still a beginner. So I'm trying to be realistic and break this into phases. I'll start by making a really basic version of it, just a clean site that can take user input and return a simple itinerary. I'll focus on getting the core features done first. Anything extra is a bonus, but I want to make sure the base idea actually works and is usable.`

`A good outcome for this project woult be that users can enter a destination and get a basic itinerary, tand google maps works and shows activity locations, and weather forecast for the trip is included.`

`A better outcome of course would be all the things I've said but a more functional and more extra version of that. So first thing would be that the itinerary adjusts travel time between stops, AI recommends spots based on preferences, and users can save their trip plans and revisit them.`

`The best outcome would be that itineraries can change BASED ON REAL TIME EVENTS like weather or closures, then users can share calendar and collaborate on group trips, and monetization ideas like affiliate links or premium features that are integrated.`

`My specific calendar would be:`
<ul>- Week 1: I’ll dive into researching the APIs (Google Maps + OpenWeather) and get a basic idea of how the project will be structured.</ul>
<ul>- Week 2–3: Start building the frontend—get some input form working and display a simple itinerary result.</ul>
<ul>- Week 4–5: Work on the backend—this is where I’ll handle user input, call the APIs, and process the data into a usable schedule. Test it, make it somewhat decent looking!</ul>

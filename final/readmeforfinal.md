# Final Project OpenWeatherMap API

### Alicia Sutedja

`Starting off this project, I tried to not use chatgpt as much. To start off the html, I saw from your website as reference and saw the code. I want to make this really simple css wise intentionally. I wanted to do rapidapi's opentripmap api, but for some reason my key wasn't working, so I ended up sticking to openweathermap api, just like what we talked about in class haha. So for the overall vibe of this code, the setup and css was pretty easy. What was hard was the process of putting my API key and fetching it. There were a lot of available resources on the internet on how to use them but for some reason it just was not showing up for the longest time. I'll put all the youtube videos I watched down there but so I got the URL wrong, not to mention I checked my api key for the longest time as well. For some reason at some point I just left it there, I followed the last youtube video on their code, especially checking multiple times which url she used and how she used the fetch code, and I just took a break. Then after around one hour, the code started to work.`

`For the link, the temperature converter was something I worked on really early in the semester, I was just joking around and was trying out different stuff. I basically asked chatgpt to give me a css template that was appealing, and the rest was basically just if else code. Of course I had chatgpt's help because I was doing this for fun and I was just trying to learn the different elements, like parseFloat can combine a string and a number, things like that. This is purely unintentional, I wasn't planning on putting this in my final, this is just additional because I thought it was kind of perfect how the temperature from the API is fahrenheit and I literally had a temperature converter thing too. Overall it was a fun project for me to do haha.`

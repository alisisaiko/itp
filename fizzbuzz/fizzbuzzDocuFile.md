# FizzBuzz Assignment
### Alicia Christina Sutedja

`So this assignment I looked at my notes from the reading that you gave us. First step was to figure out what to use (for, let, etc.) So I used for because in my notes it said it's like a while loop. Then I went ahead and did the let number from 1 and put the <100, and then used the shortcut in number++. For this one, I used a if else.`

`At first I had an error with forgetting to put quotation in Fizz and Buzz (image below). This was also before I found out that we needed to put FizzBuzz too. At least I knew that the numbers were printing so I thought I was already in the right track. So I quickly realized my problem and put quotation marks and it went well (at least for the Fizz and Buzz individually).`

`When I tried doing the FizzBuzz, I realized a mistake because I put the FizzBuzz in the last, and then I just experimented and my logic was like "Oh maybe it's because it divided by 3 and 5 first and then there's nothing left", so I quickly just tried to put it in the first if. Then turns out I was right and then it worked. yay :)`
